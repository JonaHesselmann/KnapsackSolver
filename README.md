## 01 Knapsacksolver using Branch and Bound
This is an Implementation of the Branch and Bound Algorithm and Backtracking. It uses Graphviz to Render the State Tree. Beware that the Rendering is a little bit odd

## Knapsack 
The Following Problem was solved using Branch and Bound
+  Weight of the Knapsack = 16
+  Items[weight 2, value 40; weight 5, value 30; weight 10, value 50; weight 5, value 10]

+  Best Profit = 90 with weight 12
